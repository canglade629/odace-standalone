Our main front end should be deployed in Cloud run in a single service. The backend should be all APIs and also hosted on the same Cloud Run service. I should be able to call those backend API to launch jobs, observe status, monitor etc...

All deployements should be done through Terraform. Don't forget to update those terraform scripts if needed when developing new features
